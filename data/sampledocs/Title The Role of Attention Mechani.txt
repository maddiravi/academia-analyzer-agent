Title: The Role of Attention Mechanisms in Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning for Resource Optimization

1. INTRODUCTION

The application of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) in dynamic resource management systems presents significant challenges, primarily due to the large state space and the non-stationary environment induced by multiple agents interacting simultaneously. Our primary objective is to investigate whether explicit spatial attention mechanisms can enhance cooperative policy learning among independent agents. We hypothesize that incorporating a Transformer-based attention layer will significantly improve the stability of resource allocation compared to traditional centralized approaches.

2. METHODOLOGY

We designed a simulation environment modeling a complex logistics network where six decentralized agents manage energy distribution. The core of our approach is the Attention-Enhanced Policy Gradient (AEPG) algorithm. The agents use a standard Actor-Critic architecture, but a shared self-attention module is inserted between the state encoding layer and the policy network. This module allows each agent to weigh the observations of its neighbors based on relevance, facilitating more effective state representation. We trained the system using asynchronous updates over 10,000 timesteps.

3. KEY FINDINGS

The AEPG-trained agents demonstrated a 25% improvement in long-term cumulative reward compared to the baseline systems (A2C and PPO) that lacked the attention mechanism. Crucially, the variance in resource allocation failures was reduced by 40%, directly validating our hypothesis regarding improved stability. The attention weights showed that agents learned to prioritize data from neighbors experiencing immediate resource scarcity.

4. CONCLUSION

We conclude that spatial attention mechanisms are a vital component for building scalable and stable multi-agent DRL systems for resource optimization tasks. Further research should explore the integration of graph neural networks (GNNs) with attention to better model topological relationships.
